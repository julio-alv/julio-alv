### Hello 👋

I'm a Backend Developer and DevOps Engineer.

I'm a performance-driven engineer; whether it's in a user-facing application or in development tools, I like it when things are blazingly fast.

Some other topics I really enjoy are graphics programming, database internals, and low-level programming.
